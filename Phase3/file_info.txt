Longest Value: ### National Institutes of Health Chest X-Ray Dataset

---

Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examinations available. However, clinical diagnosis of a chest X-ray can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging. The lack of large publicly available datasets with annotations means it is still very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve clinically relevant computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) in real world medical sites with chest X-rays. One major hurdle in creating large X-ray image datasets is the lack resources for labeling so many images. Prior to the release of this dataset, [Openi][1] was the largest publicly available source of chest X-ray images with 4143 images available.

This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset is comprised of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. To create these labels, the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the associated radiological reports. The labels are expected to be >90% accurate and suitable for weakly-supervised learning. The original radiology reports are not publicly available but you can find more details on the labeling process in the Open Access paper by [ChestX-ray8_Hospital-Scale_Chest_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf][30]  (*Wang et al.*).

### Content
There are 12 zip files in total and range from ~2 gb to 4 gb in size. We have grouped the zip files in six datasets and each one contains two of the zip files along with a copy of the class labels. Additionally, we took a random sample (5%) of these images and created a smaller dataset for use in Kernels. The random sample contains 5,606 X-ray images and class labels.<br><br>

### Modifications to original data

- Original TAR archives were converted to ZIP archives to be compatible with the Kaggle platform

- CSV headers slightly modified to be more explicit in comma separation and also to allow fields to be self-explanatory
